This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and trying to access the data before it's fully loaded. It happens because AsyncStorage is asynchronous, meaning it takes some time to complete its operations. If you try to use the data immediately after calling getItem, you might get undefined because the operation hasn't finished yet. This results in unexpected behavior, or crashes when the app tries to use a null value.
